# docker-ghost
Warcraft 3 Game Hosting Bot Ghost in a Docker container.


## Ghost++ variant
The first iteration of this container is going to use https://github.com/naanselmo/uc-ghost. Maybe other versions can be implemented as well.


## Example docker-infrastructure
Once the image is in a stable and customizable state a sample docker-compose file will be provided that allows using multiple bot instances to use similar configurations and share map files and a central MySQL database.
